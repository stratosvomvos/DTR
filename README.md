## Welcome to DTR!

Hi! I'm **Stratosvomvos** , I made this simple app to download torrents easier!


# Why

Well, torrenting software such as Mtorrent installs stuff on your computer (RAV antivirus) and doesn't let you do much without paying, while stuff like aria2 is very **Fast** and **works without paying** but its command-line based so its hard to use! :(

## What does DTR do then? 
Well, DTR is just a way of making Aria2 **easy to use** by only needing to **put the torrent name** and just **pressing enter!**

## How to Use DTR?
**1) (Installing)**
